      Hellooo this is current me speaking... I just wanna wish you the HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY EVER, good health and long life. I know life has been hard on you,
      that's why I wish you the HAPPIEST day ever and for you to feel better soon and if you ever need someone, I'm still here re-reading our chapter... Our story
      may be closed already but if you miss every chapter of us, you're free to open that book again and feel free to open that book again and feel free to add 
      another chapter. I also wanna say, You left too early, I wasn't done loving you yet. Pero things happen... I won't forget the times we spent together, you 
      will always be a special person to me. Maybe I'm just your once upon a time, but not your happily ever after. Like I said, I'm happy on what ever decision 
      you make, Even though you probably won't make it to the end of my story, I will always have the corner folded on your page, hoping to be in it again as it 
      was one of my favorites. Anywaysss, HAPPY HAPPY HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY to you alex, I hope you enjoy your day :)). There's also a message below I'd like you to read.

    HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY LOVEEEE! I just wanna say na you're a blessing in disguise having you is the best
    thing that happened to me this year. Tbh I like you a lot more than I've liked anyone else. Ikaw nag papagaan
    ng loob ko, you make me feel special and you also make me feel like I'm free. You have the most be beautiful face
    in the world, you existing is enough for me to be happy. I love how you're always focused on your goal and supporting
    you makes me feel happy. I love you so much na parang it's unreal. Even though I-deny mo you're perfect, like super duper.
    Napaka bait mo, considerate, smart, witty, and I also like your humor, I like you. Sinarili mo na nga ata lahat ng compliment
    na pwede matanggap ng isang person eh daya talaga. So don't be sad, if you're sad or feeling misserable I hope there is something I
    can do to make you feel better, because I wanna see you smile and I also wanna be with you on your worst and bad days. If you need someone to 
    talk to I will be always here for you always, anytime, anyday... Remember that. You have a place in my heart that no one else could ever have 
    I'm always free basta ikaw. I also left a fun survey below for you to answer if you have time, I'd glady appriciate it if you filled it in. 
    I'm sorry if ganito lang muna mabigay ko na gift sayo we haven't studied how to code html yet pero triny ko aralin mag-isa para magawan ka lang neto 
    babawi ako sa gifts sa future. Anyways, HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY LOVE, sulitin mo ang araw mo and have fun. I wish you good health and long life, I love youuu.
