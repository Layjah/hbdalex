      Hellooo this is current me speaking... I just wanna wish you the HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY EVER, good health and long life. I know life has been hard on you,
      that's why I wish you the HAPPIEST day ever and for you to feel better soon and if you ever need someone, I'm still here re-reading our chapter... Our story
      may be closed already but if you miss every chapter of us, you're free to open that book again and feel free to add another chapter. I also wanna say, You 
      left too early, I wasn't done loving you yet. Pero things happen for a reason, either you're a blessing or a lesson I won't forget the times we spent together, 
      you will always be a special person to me. You were the only person I enjoyed talking to, even when I was going through a lot and I was at my lowest, you were 
      there for me not out of pity, but because you enjoyed being with me even just for a brief moment and I love that. I'm glad that I met you I'm also glad I made some
      beautiful memories with you. I'm glad that I became a part of your life and was able to witness and expirience what a wonderful person you are. Thank you for everything,
      for telling me all your chikas, for showing me your favorite movies and shows (specialy the shrek musical), for being my person, for making me feel loved, and thank you 
      for making me smile just by texting me, sending random pictures of yourself, bella, tamiya, and daji and by calling me unexpectedly. You made me laugh and smile more than 
      anyone has. You may not be my happily ever after, at least you will be my once upon a time. Pero like I said nga, I respect every decision you make and even though you 
      probably won't make it to the end of my story, I will always have the corner folded on your page, hoping to be in it again as it was one of my favorites. I'm sorry if I 
      wasn't the best and failed to make you feel good enough, but trust me I really gave my best to let you know what genuine feels like, that's why if there is a slight chance 
      that we can try again I will always take that chance to correct things that I did wrong and do things I didn't get to do with you because you're worth it. Anywaysss, HAPPY 
      HAPPY HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY to you alex, I miss you and I will always love you, pray for you and be proud of you even from a far, you will always have a special place in my 
      heart and you will always be in my mind no matter how many years pass, our memories memories will stay with me. I HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR DAY :)) and if ever you find someone 
      else, I hope they love you as much as you do, but I doubt that they'll ever love you as much as I do, take care of tamiya, daji, bella, ginger and specialy take care of 
      yourself, until we meet again. The message below are things that I composed and recorded before things happened, you don't have to read and listen to it, but I'll appriciate 
      it if you do.

    HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY LOVEEEE! I just wanna say na you're a blessing in disguise having you are the best thing that happened to me this year. Tbh I like you 
    a lot more than I've liked anyone else. Ikaw nag papagaan ng loob ko, you make me feel safe, you make me feel special, you also make me feel like I'm free and ikaw na rin ang 
    nagiging pahinga ko. You have the most be beautiful and prettiest face in the world, you existing is enough for me to be happy. I love how you're always 
    focused on your goal and supporting you makes me feel happy. I love you so much na parang it's unreal. Even though I-deny mo, you're perfect, like super 
    duper. Napaka bait mo, considerate, smart, witty, pretty, beautiful, and I also like your humor, I like you and kahit na anong mangyari, mag pa kalbo ka man, 
    kahit you're secretly a seriel killer, idc, I will always love you what ever happens. Sinarili mo na ata lahat ng compliment na pwede matanggap ng isang person 
    eh daya talaga. So don't be sad, if you're sad or feeling misserable I hope there is something I can do to make you feel better, because I wanna see you smile 
    and I also wanna be with you on your worst and bad days. If you need someone to talk to I will be always here for you always, anytime, anyday... Remember that. 
    You have a place in my heart that no one else could ever replace, I'm always free basta ikaw. I also left a fun survey below for you to answer if you have time, 
    I'd glady appriciate it if you filled it in. I'm sorry if ganito lang muna mabigay ko na gift sayo we haven't studied how to code html yet pero triny ko aralin 
    mag-isa para magawan ka lang neto, babawi ako sa gifts sa future. Anyways, HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY LOVE, sulitin mo ang araw mo and have fun, I wish you good health and 
    long life, and I'm proud of whatever you do or achieve... Iloveyouuu.
